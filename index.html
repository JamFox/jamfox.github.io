    <p>The aerodynamics of the human form has been an area of valuableresearch in various aspects of sports and competition. Air resistance (hereinafter referred to as “drag”) is a concerning factor in many time-based trials, and enhancing potential efficiency can be done through the elucidation of the flow around the human figure. Studies concerning the drag of the human body using wind tunnels can be found dating back to the 1920s [1]. A small sampling of subsequent studies exploring theeffect of drag covers areas such as running [2], cycling [3], skiing [4], and skating [5], all of which reinforces the relevance of aerodynamic investigation on the human shape in regards to performance.</p>
    <p>In many of such studies, the authors seek to investigate the effect of positioning in relation to drag [6], and some utilize numerous subjects of differing anthropometric proportions to describe a generalized result on such positioning [7, 8]. Hitherto, none within the author’s investiga-tions has described the effect of specific physiological features on aero-dynamic performance in great detail. Stemming from certain internet communities and pertinent to the current era comes the succinct state-ment, “Flat is Justice”, which consequentially begets interesting debate that can reverberate and diffuse throughout media. Essentially, the statement describes the appreciation of flat-chested women [9], which posits a peculiar aspect that has yet to be fully explored in human aero-dynamics; namely, the effect of breasts in regards to drag and overall aerodynamic performance.</p>
    <p>This work is intended to contribute to the understanding of how large breasts can affect the dynamics of the human wake through the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation tools. This pre-liminary work focuses solely on comparing the relevant effects of large breasts of a selected human design to that of the same design but with, euphemistically, “lesser tracts of land”. The following sections will present an overall understanding on the human wake in relation to sim-plified geometry along with engineering applications, introduce the chosen human geometry and models, relevant boundary conditions, the governing equations, and the numerical methods used to solve the equa-tions. An in-depth review on the computational uncertainty is described, following with extensive results and discussion, conclusions, and rec-ommendations for future work.</p>
